# Copilot Demo at `people + ai` event

Welcome to my GitHub Copilot presentation at people + ai event in Bengaluru, India. In this presentation, I will be discussing GitHub Copilot, a groundbreaking tool that has revolutionized the way we write code. Below you will find some information on what Copilot is, its features, how to install it, and an exciting announcement about the future of Copilot.

## What is Copilot?

**GitHub Copilot is your AI pair programmer!**

GitHub Copilot is a cloud-based artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to assist users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments by autocompleting code.

## Is Copilot a magic?

We use the terms “AI pair programmer” and “Copilot” to imply that this tool cannot work without you–the developer! It’s not magic. It cannot read minds, although it sometimes feels like it can. However, by sharing code completion suggestions based on my project’s context and style conventions, GitHub Copilot increased my velocity and confidence as a programmer. It uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.

## Features of Copilot

Here are the 3 main features of GitHub Copilot:

1. **Convert comments to code**: describe the logic you want in natural language, and let Copilot assemble the code for you
2. **Autofill for repetitive code**: quickly produces boilerplate and fills in repetitive code patterns
3. **Show alternatives**: show a list of solutions to use as provided, or edit to meet your needs
